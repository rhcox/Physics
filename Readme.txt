This is a library of worksheet for physics and other technical classes.

The library generates LaTex then calls a LaTex imterpreter to generate a PDF.
The location of the LaTex interpreter may have to be changed in the code itself, iin Base.py

Base.py creates the basic outliine for a worksheet
BaseGuess.py is a etended class that places a GUESS scaffolding(Given, Unknown, ...) for the student to use to generate a process for a solution.

These classes are used by creating an instance and overriding the Page method.

This is provided as is. I wrote it to generate multiple versions of problem sets for my students

Code written bhy RH Cox.
